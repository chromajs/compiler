# chroma-compiler

This is the globalized compiler for Chroma (featuring a custom markdown compiler) and is not meant to be used directly by developers. If you're looking to create a project with Chroma, [see the documentation](https://chromajs.github.io/). If you still want to use the API to compile markdown, see [the compiler documentation](https://chromajs.github.io/docs/compiler).
