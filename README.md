# @chroma/compiler

This is the globalized compiler for Chroma (featuring a custom markdown compiler) and is not meant to be used directly by developers. If you're looking to create a project with Chroma, [see the documentation](https://chromajs.github.io/).

If you want to use the API to compile markdown programatically, see [the compiler documentation](https://chromajs.github.io/docs/compiler).
